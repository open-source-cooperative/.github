# The Open Source Cooperative

This GitHub organization is designed to house independent, open-source, actively-used-and-maintained repositories which started off owned by individuals but are now being maintained by teams that may or may not include the original owner. It allows these maintainer teams to have full control of their repository, and it allows the original owners to gracefully bow out of ongoing maintenance responsibilities.

If you have a repository that you would like to transfer into this organization, contact [@brotskydotcom](https://github.com/brotskydotcom) via email. We will figure out if the transfer makes sense, and if so make it happen.

If you are interested in helping maintain this organization as a resource for all, contact [@brotskydotcom](https://github.com/brotskydotcom) via email. We will figure out if our visions are aligned, and if so start working together.
