# The Open Source Cooperative

This GitHub organization is designed to house independent, open-source, actively-used-and-maintained repositories which started off owned by individuals and are now being maintained collaboratively by the members of the cooperative. It allows the original owners to take breaks from active maintenance work (or bow out entirely) without having to worry that their code will rot because no one is watching it. 

If you have a repository that you would like to transfer into this organization, contact [@brotskydotcom](https://github.com/brotskydotcom) via email. We will figure out if the transfer makes sense and, if so, make it happen.

If you are interested in joining the cooperative team of maintainers to keep these repos alive as a resource for all, contact [@brotskydotcom](https://github.com/brotskydotcom) via email. We are always looking for more help!
